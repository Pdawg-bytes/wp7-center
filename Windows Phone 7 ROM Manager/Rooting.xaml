Once you have downloaded the two XAP files, open the newly installed application named 'Application Deployment' on your Windows 7 system. Then, open the Zune software, and plug in your phone. In the Application Deployment window, make sure the target is set to 'Device' and NOT 'Emulator'. Then, click the 'Browse' button, and find the file called 'WP7 Root Tools 1.2.xap'. Finally, click the Deploy button. If the XAP deployed properly, move to the next step." FontSize="15" Margin="15,10,15,0" TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords"/>

When you open it, you will be greeted with a prompt to begin phase 1 of the installation. Click the Continue button if you wish to proceed. Next, the phone will do some things, don't touch it. When the device returns back to the start screen, go open the app again. Then, it'll prompt you to complete phase 2 of the installation. Click continue. The phone will proceed to reboot and it may take some time. When your phone reboots, you're done! You Windows Phone 7 Device is officially rooted! You may now re enter the app to find a registry editor, file explorer, certificate manager, and more! Enjoy the root!" FontSize="15" Margin="15,10,15,0" TextWrapping="WrapWholeWords"/>

                <TextBlock Text="If you'd like to get a little more out of the root, follow these steps. In the archive with the WP7 Root Apps, you should have another file named 'wphTweaks.xap'. This is an app that has a ton of tweaks that take advantage of your rooted device. To install it, follow steps 1 and 2. The app does not require any phase 1 or 2 install, but it does require root access. Open WP7 Root Tools, and in the 'Policies' menu, scroll until you see the tweaks app. Then, just turn on the toggle switch. Make sure to reboot your phone after, and enjoy the extra tweaks! There are many other apps out there that are great rooted apps, and they require the same deployment and root access that WP7 Tweaks requires, so if you want to find another rooted app, go ahead!"
