# WP7-Center
Windows Phone 7 Center is a UWP WinUI 2.5 app that aims to bring all the knowledge left out there about WP7, the internals, and much more. This app will be able to handle ROMs too, for example, it can dump them, convert them, and give you general info. WP7 was a great platform, with bad support, but I hope to preserve as much history about it as I can. This app is 100% free, no premium or anything needed. Enjoy!

# Building
To build this app, you need the Windows 10 SDK 19041 installed and UWP support in Visual Studio 2022. That's all to build!

# Installing
Installing this app is quite simple. You need to first install the certificate in the zip folder to Local Machine > Trusted People. Now why do you need to do this, you may ask? Well that's because the UWP container needs the app to be launched by the shell correctly, and the certificate is a code signing measure. Anyway, after installing the certificate, double click the .APPX file, then click "Install". That should let you install and run the app! Enjoy!
